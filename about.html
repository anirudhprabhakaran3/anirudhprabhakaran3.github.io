            Hi, I am Anirudh Prabhakaran. I'm currently a student at Institut Polytechnique de Paris (IP Paris),
            currently located at Telecom SudParis, Evry. I'm doing my Master 1 in Data Analysis and Pattern Recognition
            (DATAPAC), and am planning on following it up with a Master 2 in Machine Learning, Communications and
            Security (MICAS).
        </p>
        <p class="my-2">
            I am interested in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. Especially, I like working on the intersection of
            these with other domains, like medical machine learning. Recently, I've also been looking into multi-modal
            and reinforcement learning.
        </p>
        <p class="my-2">
            I also am experienced in fullstack web development. Some of the technologies I'm well-versed with include
            Django, FastAPI, Ruby on Rails, Jekyll (which powers this website!), Spring Boot, Gin, NextJS, etc. I've also worked
            with big data technologies, like Apache Flink, Apache Spark, Apache Kafka and the corresponding ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p class="my-2">
            In my free time, I like reading and music. Recently, I've started playing volleyball!
