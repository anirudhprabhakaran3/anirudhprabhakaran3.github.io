    <p class="my-2">
      Hi, I'm Anirudh Prabhakaran, a Master's student at Institut Polytechnique
      de Paris (IP Paris), currently based at Télécom SudParis in Évry. I'm
      pursuing an M1 in Data Analysis and Pattern Classification (DATAPAC) and
      plan to continue with an M2 in Machine Learning, Communications, and
      Security (MICAS).
    </p>
    <p class="my-2">
      My primary interests lie in Computer Vision and Machine Learning,
      particularly at their intersections with other fields such as medical AI.
      Lately, I've also been exploring multi-modal and reinforcement learning.
    </p>
    <p class="my-2">
      Alongside my academic work, I have strong experience in full-stack web
      development. I enjoy building efficient and scalable applications using
      frameworks and tools like Django, FastAPI, Ruby on Rails, Jekyll (which
      powers this website!), Spring Boot, Gin, and Next.js. I've also worked
      with big data technologies, including Apache Flink, Spark, and Kafka,
      along with related components from their ecosystems.
    </p>
    <p class="my-2">
      Outside of academics and coding, I enjoy reading, listening to music, and,
      more recently, playing volleyball.
